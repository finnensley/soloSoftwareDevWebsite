       <p>I worked as a fulfillment manager for a startup and ran into these issues daily while using <strong>some of the most popular solutions available.</strong></p>
       <p>It hindered the teams productivity and ability to be successful. Trying to find the correct numbers to report daily was agonizing and took forever.</p>
       <p>That is why I created soloSoftwareDev, first to create a shipping solution for startups, next who knows. The world is my oyster, so Shakespeare says.</p>
